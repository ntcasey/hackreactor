Projects and Sprints

## This repo contains projects/ sprints I solved as a student at Hack Reactor

Some of the projects require node modules. Make sure you have Node and npm if you want to test some of the projects. As long as you enter in the terminal:\

npm intall

you should be able to see what I have made. For more information, feel free to reach out.
